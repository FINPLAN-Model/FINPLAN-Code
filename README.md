This repository contains the general code for the Model for Financial Analysis of Electric Sector Expansion Plans (FINPLAN). FINPLAN was developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to help assess the financial viability of plans and projects. It considers different financial sources - export credits, commercial loans, bonds, equity and modern instruments like swaps - and calculates projected cash flows, balance sheets, financial ratios and other financial indicators.
